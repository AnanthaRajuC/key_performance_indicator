<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

Performance metrics are for monitoring stability, progress, alerts, and so forth.


<h2><a name="metrics-areas">Metrics areas</a></h2>

To define a metric, be sure to cover at least these areas:

* Title: use an exact name to avoid ambiguity
* Objective: the relation of the metric with the organizational objectives must be clear
* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that are included and/or excluded.
* Target: Benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress
* Formula: the exact calculation of the metric
* Units: what is/are the unit(s) of measurement in use
* Frequency: when is the metric recorded and reported
* Data source: the exact data sources involved in calculating a metric value
* Owner: the accountable person for the metric
* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the metric


<h2><a name="metrics-guidelines">Metrics guidelines</a></h2>

Metrics guidelines that can help keep you on track:

* Does it clearly define what constitutes business excellence?
* Does it provide the information required to set aggressive yet achievable strategic objectives and stretch goals?
* Does it accurately portray progress and probability of achieving both long-term strategic objectives and near-term milestones?
* Does it identify the root causes of barriers?
* Does it focus the organization on the priority improvement needs?
* Does it drive the behavior and actions required to achieve the objectives?
* Does it align work with value?
* Is it easy to use?
* Does it involve everyone?


<h2><a name="finance">Finance</a></h2>

Money:
* Sales growth
* Improved cash flow
* ROI or ROE

Customer value:
* Customer on-time delivery %
* Customer lead time reductions
* Customer satisfaction ratings

Operations improvements:
* Inventory turns
* Overall trhoughput
* Lead time reductions

Productivity improvements:
* Overall efficiency % gains
* Sales per employee


<h2><a name="value-stream-maps">Value stream maps (VSMs)</a></h2>

Value stream primary metrics:
* Units per person
* On-time delivery % by product
* Quality first pass yield
* Average cost per unit
* Dock-to-dock times

Value stream support metrics:
* OEE at the constraint level
* Average of cross training hours per person
* Number of safety incidents


<h2><a name="business-process">Business process</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples for gauging business process performance:

* Percentage of processes where completion falls within +/- 5% of the estimated completion
* Average process overdue time
* Percentage of overdue processes
* Average process age
* Percentage of processes where the actual number assigned resources is less than planned number of assigned resources
* Sum of costs of “killed” / stopped active processes
* Average time to complete task
* Sum of deviation of time (e.g. in days) against planned schedule of all active projects


<h2><a name="efficiency">Efficiency</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples indicating Efficiency performance:

* Cycle time from request to delivery
* Average cycle time from request to delivery
* Call length
* Volume of tasks per staff
* Number of staff involved
* Number of reminders
* Number of alerts
* Customer ratings of service
* Number of customer complaints
* Number of process errors
* Number of human errors
* Time allocated for administration, management, training


<h2><a name="compliance">Compliance</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples for Compliance performance:

* Average time lag between identification of external compliance issues and resolution
* Frequency (in days) of compliance reviews
* Budget – Key Performance Indicators


<h2><a name="service-level-agreement">Service level agreement (SLA)</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples of SLA performance:

* Percentage of service requests resolved within an agreed-upon/acceptable period of time
* Cost of service delivery as defined in Service Level Agreement (SLA) based on a set period such as month or quarter
* Percentage of outage (unavailability) due to implementation of planned changes, relative to the service hours
* Average time (e.g. in hours) between the occurrence of an incident and its resolution
* Downtime – the percentage of the time service is available
* Availability – the total service time = the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the mean time to repair (MTTR)
* Number of outstanding actions against last SLA review
* The deviation of the planned budget (cost) is the difference in costs between the planned baseline against the actual budget of the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
* Percentage of correspondence replied to on time
* Percentage of incoming service requests of customers have to be completely answered within x amount of time
* Number of complaints received within the measurement period
* Percentage of customer issues that were solved by the first phone call
* Number of operator activities per call – maximum possible, minimum possible, and average. (E.g. take call, log call, attempt dispatch, retry dispatch, escalate dispatch, reassign dispatch, etc.)
* The number of answered phone call per hour
* Total Calling Time per Day or week.
* Average queue time of incoming phone calls
* Cost per minute of handle time
* Number of un-responded emails
* Average after call work time (work done after call has been concluded)
* Costs of operating a call centre / service desk, usually for a specific period such as month or quarter
* Average number of calls / service requests per employee of call center / service desk within measurement period
* Number of complaints received within the measurement period


<h2><a name="service-quality">Service quality</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples for gauging Service Quality performance:

* Cycle time from request to delivery
* Call length – the time to answer a call
* Volume of calls handled – per call centre staff
* Number of escalations how many bad
* Number of reminders – how many at risk
* Number of alerts – overall summary
* Customer ratings of service – customer satisfaction
* Number of customer complaints – problems
* Number of late tasks – late
* Efficiency – Key Performance Indicators
