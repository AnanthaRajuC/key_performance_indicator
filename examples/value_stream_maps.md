* Percentage of overdue processes
* Average process age
* Percentage of processes where the actual number assigned resources is less than planned number of assigned resources
* Sum of costs of “killed” / stopped active processes
* Average time to complete task
* Sum of deviation of time (e.g. in days) against planned schedule of all active projects


<h2><a name="efficiency">Efficiency</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples indicating Efficiency performance:

* Cycle time from request to delivery
* Average cycle time from request to delivery
* Call length
* Volume of tasks per staff
* Number of staff involved
* Number of reminders
* Number of alerts
* Customer ratings of service
* Number of customer complaints
* Number of process errors
* Number of human errors
* Time allocated for administration, management, training


<h2><a name="compliance">Compliance</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples for Compliance performance:

<h2><a name="service-level-agreement">Service level agreement (SLA)</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples of SLA performance:

* Percentage of service requests resolved within an agreed-upon/acceptable period of time
* Cost of service delivery as defined in Service Level Agreement (SLA) based on a set period such as month or quarter
* Percentage of outage (unavailability) due to implementation of planned changes, relative to the service hours
* Average time (e.g. in hours) between the occurrence of an incident and its resolution
* Downtime – the percentage of the time service is available
* Availability – the total service time = the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the mean time to repair (MTTR)
* Number of outstanding actions against last SLA review
* The deviation of the planned budget (cost) is the difference in costs between the planned baseline against the actual budget of the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
* Percentage of correspondence replied to on time
* Percentage of incoming service requests of customers have to be completely answered within x amount of time
* Number of complaints received within the measurement period
* Percentage of customer issues that were solved by the first phone call
* Number of operator activities per call – maximum possible, minimum possible, and average. (E.g. take call, log call, attempt dispatch, retry dispatch, escalate dispatch, reassign dispatch, etc.)
* The number of answered phone call per hour
* Total Calling Time per Day or week.
* Average queue time of incoming phone calls
* Cost per minute of handle time
* Number of un-responded emails
* Average after call work time (work done after call has been concluded)
* Costs of operating a call centre / service desk, usually for a specific period such as month or quarter
* Average number of calls / service requests per employee of call center / service desk within measurement period
* Number of complaints received within the measurement period


<h2><a name="service-quality">Service quality</a></h2>

The following are KPI examples for gauging Service Quality performance:

* Cycle time from request to delivery

* Number of reminders – how many at risk
* Number of alerts – overall summary
* Customer ratings of service – customer satisfaction
* Number of customer complaints – problems
* Number of late tasks – late
* Efficiency – Key Performance Indicators
